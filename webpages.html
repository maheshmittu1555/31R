    <section><h1>ABOUT:</h1>
    <p>One of the boys with whom Deva (Prabhas) plays cricket in the nondescript town of Tinsukia in Assam refers to his towering persona as ‘cutout’, a word that is commonly used by the star’s fans. Director Prashanth Neel uses this throwaway reference to reaffirm that this film, mounted on a massive scale, is a celebration of Prabhas’s stardom. At its bare bones, Salaar: Part 1 – the Ceasefire is a story of two friends — Deva and Varadaraja Mannar aka Varada (a regal, understated Prithviraj Sukumaran) — who turn enemies. It is a storyline that Neel has explored earlier. A considerable portion of Salaar draws from the director’s earlier Kannada film Ugramm; he repackages it in a KGF style, with stylised action choreography, and narrates it in the backdrop of a dystopian kingdom named Khansaar, depicted in soot-laden monochrome hues.</p><br>
    <p>A childhood episode between Deva and Varada delineates why the former is indebted to the other and would go any length to stand by him. When the story takes a leap from the 1980s to 2017, Deva is in exile, working as a mechanic while his mother (Easwari Rao), scarred and seething from a bitter past, is a school teacher who wants children of coal mine workers to be educated so that they stand a chance for better future. Other characters that bear scars of the past and are waiting to settle scores include Radha Rama Mannar (Sriya Reddy) and her loyal aide Obulamma (Jhansi).</p><br>
    <p>If the first hour seems like a mere set up, the later portions have quite a bit to unpack. We get a gist of the history of Khansaar and its three principal tribes, from the 12th century till the present and how the battlelines are drawn. Neel presents Khansaar as a present-day land, with the mention of mobile phones and aircraft, but takes cinematic liberty to give it a medieval treatment with tribal accessories, a fortress and a parliament building that has an old world court design replete with thrones. There is an attention to detail in building the world of Khansaar, its constitution, voting rules, and more. TL Venkatachalapathi’s production design deserves a mention.</p><br>
    <p>If Khansaar seems impenetrable with its high walls and induces fear among those outside, there is also a smart reasoning of how this kingdom also has reasons to fear.In this story of violent men, most women are reduced to shedding tears and having to be saved from becoming preys of sexual violence. The colour red is used to demarcate the tribal women in despair; vermillion red comes to fore when they pray to Goddess Kaateramma and much later the colour is used to denote aggression in men who are manipulated to behave like ‘wild dogs’. When Deva declares it is time to paint Khansaar red, it sets the stage for full-blown bloodbath</p><br>
